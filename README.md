# Digital-Soil-Mapping

The following appendices contain all R-codes to run and replicate statistical analyses presented in the following paper:
Beguin, J., Fuglstad, G-A., Mansuy, N, Paré, N. 2017. Predicting soil properties in the Canadian boreal forest with limited data: comparison of spatial and non-spatial statistical approaches. Geoderma, in press.

# Appendix 1.1 demonstrates how to use the following methods presented in the paper for the dataset "Meuse":
1) Methods: random forests, boosted regression trees, weighted-KNN, cubist, generalised linear (GLM) and additive (GAM) models       
2) Performing repeated k-fold cross-validation                            
3) Performing sensitivity analyses on model parameters (if needed)         
4) Mapping predicted values (example with random forests)         

# Appendix 1.2 demonstrates how to use the following methods presented in the paper for the dataset "Meuse":
1) Methods: ordinary kriging, regression-kriging & random forests-kriging
2) Fitting the model
3) Performing repeated k-fold cross-validation
4) Mapping predicted values

# Appendix 1.3 demonstrates how to use the following methods presented in the paper for the dataset "Meuse":
1) Method: Bayesian geostatistical model (SPDE/INLA)
2) Fitting the model
3) Performing repeated k-fold cross-validation
4) Mapping predicted values: estimates + uncertainty
